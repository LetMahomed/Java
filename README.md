# Overview
I created this project to practice core Java programming concepts and improve my understanding of how real-world applications are structured. The goal was to build a simple but functional program that uses object-oriented principles, data storage, and user interaction.

This software is an Expense Tracker that allows users to record expenses, view them, and calculate totals. Each expense includes details, a description, category, and amount. The program stores expense data in a file so it can be reused later.

I created this software to strengthen my skills in Java, especially working with classes, interfaces, inheritance, collections, and file input/output. This project helped me understand how different parts of a Java program work together.
